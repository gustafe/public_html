<h1>What's all this about, then?</h1>

<p>This is a little page that scrapes the APIs for 
<a href="https://lobste.rs">Lobste.rs</a>, 
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, and 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/">Reddit's /r/Programming</a>, 
compares URLs for submissions, and prints a match if the URLs are the same.</p>

<p>I wrote it to give more depth to the  discussions on Lobste.rs.</p>

<p>The numbers at the end of each submission is the score (net number of
upvotes), the number of comments, and the comment/score ratio. The
ratio is only printed if the sum of the score and comments is 10 or
more.</p>

<p><a name="changelog"/></p>

<h2>Changelog</h2>

<ul>
<li>2021-05-31 - HTTPS implemented    </li>
<li>2019-08-20 - links from /r/Programming that are shared with the links on Lobste.rs are now shown.</li>
<li>2019-08-15 - Link  now show multiple entries, if they're present. Items are often reposted on HN , and previously just the first occurence in time was presented. </li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>A script is run hourly, reading the latest entries from both
sites. Then the page is generated.</p>

<p>The SQL is basically </p>

<pre><code>select lo.url from lobsters lo
left outer  join hackernews hn 
on hn.url = lo.url
left outer join proggit pr
on pr.url = lo.url
</code></pre>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>It only matches URLs exactly, so if there are extraneous elements in a
submission to one site, it won't show up.</p>

<p>While the HN API offers a list of the latest 500 entries, the script
only scan the <a href="https://lobste.rs/newest"><code>/newest</code></a> page on Lobste.rs,
and if the number of new entries manages to replace the page entirely
between reads, the script might miss entries.</p>

<p>The scores and comments are only updated occasionally as I don't want to overload the API endpoints.</p>

<ul>
<li>top scoring and commented post per year</li>
<li>better formatting of archive page</li>
<li>ensure "last generated on" JS code works in different timezones</li>

<li><strike>present data for ratios etc. in an informative way</strike></li>
<li><strike>add Lobste.rs tags to entries</strike></li>
<li><strike>stats pages at end of each month</strike></li>
