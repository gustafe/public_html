<h1>GDPR Privacy Notice for gerikson.com</h1>

<p>This is a private site, all content is created by me, Gustaf
Erikson.</p>

<p>No data is being collected from anyone who visits this site, apart
from what can be gleaned from the HTTP access logs.</p>

<p>No data is shared to third parties.</p>

<p>Access log data is used to determine whether access to this site is
being abused (i.e. via DDoS attack).</p>

<p>Data is stored for the duration of 10 access log rotations - at the
time of writing this is around one week.</p>

<p>I will not remove any data from the logs before it is rotated
out.</p>

<p>Complaints and questions can be raised via the details in
my <a href="http://gerikson.com/blog/meta/contact.html">contact
page</a>.</p>
