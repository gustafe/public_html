=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: acronym

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Allows you to create a list of acronyms and abbreviations that are automatically converted to a <acronym> tag  whenever they are used in a story.  You can insert "<!-- noacronym -->" in a story to prevent any changes

You can set your own location for the acronym data file, but by default it lives in your data directory.
